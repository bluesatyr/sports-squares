Great that the syntax error is gone! That clears up a major hurdle.

Now, regarding the `game_state` not updating for both 'Start Game' and when fetching ESPN scores: this strongly points to an issue with **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** on your `game_state` table in Supabase. Your application is sending the `UPDATE` requests, but the database is likely rejecting them due to these policies.

I provided detailed instructions on how to check and adjust these policies previously. **It is crucial that you perform these steps.**

**Please confirm:**
*   Have you gone into your Supabase dashboard, navigated to the `game_state` table policies, and either **temporarily disabled RLS** or added an **UPDATE policy** that allows your application to modify the rows?

If you have adjusted the RLS policies, please try running the 'Start Game' or 'Fetch Live Scores' actions again from the Admin Dashboard, and then:
1.  **Check your browser's developer console** (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) for any errors (in red). Since I added more robust error logging, you should see a detailed error object if the Supabase update still fails.
2.  **Check your Supabase `game_state` table** to see if `is_locked`, `home_shuffled_scores`, `away_shuffled_scores`, `home_score`, `away_score`, or `current_quarter` have been updated.

Let me know the results, especially any console errors if they still occur after adjusting RLS.
